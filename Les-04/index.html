               <h6>First, give the file a name. Usually 'index.html' is used for web projects. 
                   The next thing you do is uploading this file to Github. Ather that is completed succesfully, you will see this file appear. 
                    If you are happy with your file and the possible changes you've made within this file, the last step is to press 'commit to master'. </h6>
