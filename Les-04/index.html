               <div class="stap3">ADD NEW FILE TO REPOSITORY & COMMIT TO MASTER</div>
               <div class="h5">First, give the file a name. Usually 'index.html' is used for web projects. 
                   The next thing you do is uploading this file to Github. Ather that is completed succesfully, you will see this file appear. 
                    If you are happy with your file and the possible changes you've made within this file, select the file and press 'commit to master'. Then press 'push origin'.
                    When the file is commited to master and pushed to origin, it will be visable in your history.</div>

                <div class="h6">If you've made changes in your uploaded file, you have to upload it again for the changes to be visable. 
                    All you have to do is to select the file, then press 'commit to master' and 'push origin' again.</div>

                <div class="h7">When your files are updated and uploaded, you can find a link to the pages in your settings. 
                    It may take a while before the page is correctly shown online, but if you refresh your page it will show eventually.</div>
